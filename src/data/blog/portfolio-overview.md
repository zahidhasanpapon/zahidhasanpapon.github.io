Here’s a snapshot of what I’m building right now:

- **Personal site refresh** — migrating to Astro, tightening performance, and adding better content organization.
- **Component library experiments** — testing lightweight UI patterns that stay framework-agnostic.
- **Automation** — scripting the repetitive dev and content tasks so I can ship updates faster.

I’ll keep this page updated as projects evolve. If you’re curious about a particular area, let me know and I’ll write it up.
