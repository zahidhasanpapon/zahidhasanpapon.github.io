Hello! I’m Zahid Hasan Papon. I build web experiences and share what I learn along the way. This site will host short notes, project breakdowns, and things that help me (and hopefully you) ship faster.

What to expect here:

- Build logs for the projects I’m working on.
- Practical snippets and small writeups instead of long theory dumps.
- Occasional deep dives when I solve an interesting problem.

If you want to follow along, grab the RSS feed or connect with me on GitHub. Feel free to reach out if you have ideas you’d like me to explore next.
